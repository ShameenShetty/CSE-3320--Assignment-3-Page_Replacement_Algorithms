# CSE-3320--Assignment-3-Page_Replacement_Algorithms
Third assignment for CSE3320 (Operating Systems) where we are tasked to write a program that implements the FIFO, Optimal, MFU, and LRU page-replacement algorithms. Given a page-reference string, where page numbers range from 0 to 9, we apply the page-reference string to each algorithm, and output the number of page faults incurred by each algorithm.  We write our code such that the numer of page frames in the page table can vary from 1 to 10.
